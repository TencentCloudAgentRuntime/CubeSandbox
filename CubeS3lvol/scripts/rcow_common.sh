#
#  === Why these scripts exist at all ===
#
#  s3lvol_tgt comes up empty: no bdevs, no NVMf transport, no subsystems, no
#  lvstore. Every one of those has to be re-established after each boot, in an
#  order where two of the steps are dangerous to get wrong:
#
#    - create vs. attach of the lvstore. Create formats the WAL device; attach
#      replays it. Choosing create when an lvstore already exists destroys the
#      only copy of writes that were acknowledged but not yet in S3. The choice
#      is therefore made from /data/cubelet/rcow/bstore.json and from nothing
#      else -- never from "the attach failed, so let us try create".
#
#    - reproducing the host-side namespace layout. Which volume sat on which
#      subsystem and nsid is recorded in /data/cubelet/rcow/active_lvols,
#      because it
#      cannot be recomputed: the nsid of a volume that was moved is not its
#      hash, and the host's /dev/nvmeXnY numbering follows discovery order.
#
#  === The subsystem grid ===
#
#  RCOW_NUM_SUBSYS subsystems, each created with max_namespaces =
#  RCOW_NS_PER_SUBSYS, all listening on the same address and port, all connected
#  by the initiator at startup. Both numbers must match RCOW_NUM_SUBSYS and
#  RCOW_NS_PER_SUBSYS in module/bdev/s3lvol/vbdev_s3lvol.h, and the NQN pattern
#  must match RCOW_NQN_PREFIX plus a two-digit index there: the module derives
#  the NQN it attaches to from the same arithmetic, and a mismatch shows up as
#  "subsystem N does not exist" from rcow_active_bdev.
#
#  The -m flag on nvmf_create_subsystem is not optional. Without it a subsystem
#  defaults to 32 namespaces and any nsid above that is refused with "NSID
#  greater than maximum not allowed" -- a message that only appears in the target
#  log, while the RPC just reports a failed add.

# Guard against being sourced twice: rcow_recovery.sh may hand over to
# rcow_start.sh, and re-running the derivations below would be harmless but the
# guard makes it obvious that it does not happen.

#
# It is a transport option, not a subsystem one, and it is what the host is told:
# ctrlr.c:3264 derives MDTS from it as log2(max_io_size / 4096), so the initiator's
# max_hw_sectors_kb follows. At the default the kernel cuts every 1 MiB request
# into eight 128 KiB commands; at 1 MiB it sends one, and because the bdev sets
# split_on_optimal_io_boundary with a 1 MiB boundary, that one command lands
# inside a single chunk -- one S3 object -- rather than straddling two.
#
# Upper bound: nvmf refuses the transport outright if
# max_io_size / iobuf.large_bufsize > SPDK_NVMF_MAX_SGL_ENTRIES (tcp.c:835),
# which with the 132 KiB default large_bufsize and 16 entries allows just over
# 2 MiB. 1 MiB gives 7 of the 16.
#
# What this does *not* do: make one host I/O one bdev I/O. io_unit_size stays at
# 128 KiB, so nvmf still hands over eight buffers, and the bdev layer splits them
# into eight single-segment children because s3_bs_dev only accepts iovcnt == 1
# (max_num_segments = 1, vbdev_s3lvol_lvol.c:364). The win here is on the wire and
# in chunk alignment. Collapsing it further would need either io_unit_size at
# 1 MiB -- which requires raising iobuf's large_bufsize and costs
# num_shared_buffers x 1 MiB of memory per poll group -- or multi-iovec support in
# s3_bs_dev. Neither is done here.

# iobuf: how many pieces a host I/O arrives in.
#
# The knob for this is not the transport's io_unit_size -- lib/nvmf/tcp.c does not
# reference that option at all in this version. What decides it is iobuf's buffer
# size (transport.c:209 copies it into the transport, and :922-931 does the
# arithmetic):
#
#     io_unit_size = length > small_bufsize ? large_bufsize : small_bufsize
#     num_buffers  = ceil(length / io_unit_size)
#
# With the 132 KiB default, a 1 MiB read arrives as 8 buffers, so 8 iovecs, and
# because the bdev sets max_num_segments = 1 (s3_bs_dev only accepts iovcnt == 1)
# the bdev layer splits it into 8 children -- 8 S3 object operations for one host
# I/O. Measured with bdev_get_iostat: read_ops +8. At 1 MiB it is one buffer, one
# bdev I/O, one object.
#
# The price is in that same expression: **anything larger than small_bufsize
# (8 KiB) takes a whole large buffer**. A 16 KiB read now pins 1 MiB instead of
# 132 KiB. iobuf has exactly two size classes, so this cannot be shaped further
# without moving small_bufsize up as well, which would then waste on 4 KiB I/O.
# The pool count is what bounds the total: exhausting it makes requests wait in
# iobuf (transport.c:943 passes an entry, so they queue and are retried), which
# costs latency, not correctness.
#
# 512 x 1 MiB = 512 MiB, against the 1024 x 132 KiB = 132 MiB it replaces. Keep
# RCOW_TGT_MEM_MB in step: the pools come out of the DPDK allocation.
#
# Set through iobuf_set_options, which is a *startup* RPC

# Host-side readahead for every activated volume, in KiB. Matches the chunk size
# for the same reason RCOW_MAX_IO_SIZE does. 0 disables the tuning entirely.
#
# **Exported to the target**, which is what actually applies it: the module sets
# readahead the moment a volume resolves to a device (get_bdev_write_one), which
# is earlier than any script can manage and needs no cooperation from whoever
# activated the volume. Exporting rather than only setting is the same bargain as
# S3LVOL_ACTIVE_FILE above -- with two independent values, the two layers would
# write different numbers to the same sysfs file and silently undo each other.
# rcow_tune_readahead() below then only has to cover volumes that were already
# active before the target learned this.
#
# Why it is worth the attention: what a cold read costs is one S3 request, near
# enough regardless of how many bytes it asks for. Measured on this stack, at a
# queue depth of 64:
#
#     bs=128k   797 IOPS    99.6 MB/s
#     bs=1M     252 IOPS   251.7 MB/s
#
# Same order of requests, eight times the data. So a sequential reader that lets
# the kernel read ahead a whole chunk pays one request where it used to pay
# eight. With the kernel default of 128 KiB against a 1 MiB chunk, a single
# threaded sequential read (md5sum, tar, cp) measured 6.1 MB/s; at 1024 KiB the
# same read measured 29.4 MB/s.
#
# It also compounds with the chunk cache: a 1 MiB aligned read populates a whole
# slot in one go (s3_cache.c), so the *second* pass over the same data is served
# locally -- 481 MB/s measured, against 342 with the kernel default.
#
# The cost is read amplification on random small reads -- 4 KiB asked for, up to
# 1 MiB fetched. That is a real cost for a random-only workload; set this to 128
# for the kernel default, or 0 to leave devices strictly alone. Neither is a
# correctness risk, and the cache's residency bitmap means the extra bytes are

# Run without hugepages, deliberately, rather than as a fallback for a node
# nobody has tuned.
#
# What hugepages buy DPDK is TLB coverage and physically contiguous memory that
# can be pinned and handed to a device for DMA. This target needs neither:
#
#   - the only local block device is bdev_aio, which reaches the disk through
#     read/write syscalls, so the kernel copies from ordinary process memory and
#     no IOVA is involved;
#   - the network side is nvmf_tcp over kernel sockets, again syscalls;
#   - S3 traffic goes through aws-c-s3, whose buffers are its own malloc'd
#     memory and never DPDK's.
#
# So nothing in this data path programs a device with a physical address, which
# is the one thing --no-huge takes away (DPDK cannot resolve IOVAs for
# non-hugepage memory, so a VFIO/uio driver -- bdev_nvme on a real PCIe SSD,
# virtio -- would not work). Adding such a bdev is the moment to revisit this.
#
# What it costs is TLB pressure on the DPDK heap, which here is mostly the iobuf
# pools. Worth measuring before assuming it matters, and easy to switch back:
# RCOW_NO_HUGE=0 with hugepages reserved.

#

# let a second target start on top of a live one, and the newcomer took over
# /var/run/s3lvol.sock (the RPC server unlinks the path before binding), leaving the
# first process alive, holding the lvstore and the WAL image, and unreachable.

# has been replaced, which `make` does on every build. Left unhandled it makes
# the identity check fail against exactly the target this script is most likely
# to be asked to stop -- the one running the binary that was just rebuilt -- and

# -EBUSY. It deliberately does not expire: expiry would need a liveness judgement
# that has no correct answer from the S3 side, and getting it wrong means two
# processes writing the same objects.
#
# Which leaves a crash needing a decision that only something outside S3 can
# make. On a single-owner node that decision is mechanical:
#
#   the marker names this host, and the pid it names is not running a target
#   -> the holder is a process that died, and forcing is safe
#
#   anything else -> refuse
#
# The holder's identity reaches only the target log (s3_owner.c:332 formats it
# there; the RPC returns a bare -EBUSY), so it is read from the log -- but only
# from the bytes appended by the attempt just made, so that a line left by an
# earlier attach cannot be mistaken for this one's. If the line is not found, the
# answer is "refuse": an unconfirmed force is exactly what the marker exists to

# === Why the path is tested with -b and not merely for being non-empty ===
#
# The path is not stored or predicted; the module looks it up by matching the lvol
# uuid against the namespace uuid in sysfs (vbdev_s3lvol_active.c). So a non-empty
# answer means *sysfs* has the namespace -- and the device node under /dev is
# created afterwards, by udev. The gap between the two is small and easy to miss:
# it took running the whole test suite back to back, on a busier machine than a
# single run leaves behind, for a dd to hit "No such file or directory" on a path
# this function had just declared present.
#
# Which matters beyond the tests, because rcow_start.sh calls this after a replay
# and logs "all N active volume(s) resolve to a block device" on the strength of
# it. Anything reading that line and opening the device would race udev.

# Resolving the lvstore name
#
# Placed at the very bottom because it needs rcow_bstore_entry() and the logging
# helpers; the variable itself is declared up with the rest of the configuration.
#
# Why per-node at all: the name is the key prefix (see the comment at the
# declaration), so nodes sharing a bucket must not share a name. Nothing in the
# module enforces that -- the owner marker under `<prefix>/meta/owner` catches the
# cases that happen one after another (a second node attaching while the first
# holds it, or after the first crashed), but s3_owner.h is explicit that it cannot
# catch two nodes acquiring at the same time, and a clean shutdown *releases* the
# marker, so it is not there to catch a same-named node starting later. Per §1.3 of
# the design doc, single-writer is an upper-layer guarantee. This is that layer
# doing its part.
#
# A truncated digest of the identity hostname is what makes it per-node: stable
# across reboots, needs no coordination, and does not leak the hostname into
# bucket keys. DNS names still use hostname -s (the label before the first
# dot) so an existing one-click prefix survives a domain-suffix change.
# Addresses and dotted hostnames with a numeric short name (192.0.2.48,
# 192.0.2.48.internal -> short name "192", one prefix per /8) hash in full.
#
# On collisions, honestly: 4 bytes is 32 bits, so for N nodes in one bucket the
# birthday probability is roughly N^2 / 2^33 -- about 1 in 8600 at a thousand
# nodes, and about 1.2% at ten thousand. That is not negligible at scale, and a
# collision is exactly the corruption described above. Two things to know:
#
#   - it is not silent if the colliding node is the *second* one to start, because
#     the owner marker is present and attach refuses with -EBUSY;
#   - it *is* silent when the first node is cleanly stopped and the second starts
#     afterwards with no bstore.json entry of its own, which is the create path.
#     Closing that needs a "is this prefix empty" check before create; it is not
#     implemented, and widening the hash does not substitute for it.
#
# Use RCOW_LVS_NAME to pin a name from the orchestrator if you have real node ids;
# a name you assign beats a hash of a hostname you happen to have.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# What a node created before the name became per-node has its data under.
